# Data Analysis of Academic Publications

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data from academic publications to uncover patterns and trends in scholarly research. By examining various attributes of publications such as authorship, publication venues, and research topics, we aim to provide insights that can inform researchers, institutions, and policymakers.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and visualization.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and analysis.
- `results/`: Output files including visualizations and summary reports.
- `README.txt`: Overview and instructions for the project.
